Kodi Launchers - Multiple Kodi build launcher apps for Linux
</div></b></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Suggested current Omega Launcher with working Live TV & Sports dependencies is named:<br>
Kodi.Launcher.Flatpak.Omega.sh<br><br>
These are useful mostly to admins/mods (using Linux) of groups with multiple<br>
builds that want to change really quickly to a build to produce screenshots /<br>
videos for support, or build enthusiasts that switch such a number of builds.<br>
Just click on a build, all necessary actions will be done, and Kodi will open<br>
your build.<br>
Kodi check loads a blank Kodi you prepared, with Diggz URL and wizard so you can<br>
install a new build faster. Clicking on Store builds will delete that build if<br>
you don't rename it to include it in a Kodi launcher properly.<br>
<br>
Available versions:<br>
Kodi.Launcher.Dual.sh ----- Dual launcher -System Omega & Flatpak Matrix.<br>
Kodi.Launcher.Flatpak.Dual.sh ----- Flatpak only dual launcher -Nexus & Matrix.<br>
Kodi.Launcher.Flatpak.Omega.sh ----- Flatpak only Omega launcher.<br>
Kodi.Launcher.sh ----- Simple Nexus or Omega launcher.<br>
Download any of the above here:<br>
https://mega.nz/folder/aeBiABAB#8VbOIeUJggEstJVTwlHqXg<br>
<br>
Make it executable eg with:<br>
chmod +x Kodi.Launcher.sh<br>
Dependencies: yad, thunar, kitty.<br>
<br>
You may use multiple Launchers at once.<br>
<br><br>
Notes on making it work, renaming or removing builds from Kodi Launcher:<br>
Flatpak Kodi (system Kodi uses .kodi instead of data, replace data with .kodi<br>
below for the current version) uses one exclusive folder named data and executes<br>
only that, so a renaming procedure must take place to select multiple builds.<br>
The big issue was to find a way for Launcher to automatically recognize the<br>
build in "data" folder, and rename it to the build name, so you can change<br>
builds.<br>
The solution I'm using is to place empty text filenames inside each build that<br>
the script recognizes, so place those text files and rename your builds folders<br>
 according to the app. Example in .kodiX folder, there is the Xenon Plus build,<br>
 and you have to place inside the folder an empty text file named: XenonPlus<br>
